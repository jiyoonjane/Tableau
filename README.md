## Dashboard Overview

1. **Profit Hotspots Map**  
   - A geographic scatterplot of all sales locations in South Korea  
   - Circle size = sales volume; color gradient = profit (orange = loss, blue = high profit)  
   - Quickly pinpoints cities or areas where profit issues are most severe

2. **Product‑Region Profit Analysis**  
   - Bar charts of sales by product sub‑category across major regions (Capital, Yeongnam, Honam, Chungcheong, Gangwon)  
   - Highlights the lowest‑margin products (e.g., “Chairs” in the Capital region)  
   - Side‑by‑side comparison to see which product lines are dragging down profitability in each area

3. **Time Series Profit Trends**  
   - Monthly line chart (2016–2019) of cumulative sales vs. cumulative profit  
   - Reveals when profit gaps first emerged and how they’ve widened over time  
   - Shows seasonal peaks in sales (e.g., year‑end spikes) versus flat or negative profit growth in certain months

## Key Takeaways

- **Where are profit issues most acute?**  
  - Regions around Busan and Daejeon exhibit a high concentration of low‑profit or loss‑making locations.  
  - Northern Gangwon shows sporadic but sharp loss events.

- **Which products are under‑profitable?**  
  - In the Capital region, **Chairs** and **Tables** generate strong sales but yield slim margins.  
  - In Yeongnam, **Office Machines** (e.g., Fax/Printers) show negative profitability trends.

- **When did profit shortfalls begin?**  
  - From late 2017 onward, cumulative profit growth lags behind sales growth—especially in Q1 and Q3.  
  - Despite robust holiday sales in December, January profits dip, indicating rising costs or discounting pressures.
